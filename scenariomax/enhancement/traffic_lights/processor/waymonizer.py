            List[List[int]]: A list of lists, where each inner list contains lane center IDs that

        The function performs the following steps:
        1. Defines a helper function `_is_connection_group` to check if a group of lane centers
        forms a connection group.
        2. Initializes a Union-Find data structure to group lane centers based on their connections.
        3. Iterates through lane centers and their neighbors to form initial groups.
        4. Further refines the groups by considering external lane centers with both exit and entry lanes.
        5. Filters the groups based on the specified intersection type using predefined criteria.
        Note:
            - The function relies on several instance attributes such as `self.lanecenters`,
            `self._POINT_CLOSE_THRESHOLD`,
              `self._signalized_intersection_criteria`, and `self._stop_intersection_criteria`.

            elsewhere in the codebase.
